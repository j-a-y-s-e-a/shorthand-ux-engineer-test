# Jordan Collins - Shorthand Project

## Installation

This project was created with create-next-app. To see it in action, simply run:

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm run dev
```

and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> Note: I'm using a dummy api call that relies on localhost:3000. If you use a different port, update the BASE_URL in /lib/constants.ts accordingly.
